# PBDW_IGBT_thermal
This project uses the Parameterized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) method to recover the thermal field distribution of an IGBT module, based on measured data.

This project is a direct application of the following two papers, where the PBDW method is deduced and applied in various scenarios (acoustic, etc.). In this project, we study the temperature distribution on the surface of an IGBT module.
